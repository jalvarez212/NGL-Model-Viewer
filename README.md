# NGL-Model-Viewer
Framework for rendering atomic structures in 3D on the web. 

#Set-up

Webapp3.html calls ngl.js to load and render 3d model data in browser. ngl.js creates a canvas in <div id="viewport">


#Known Bugs
1) Canvas goes black on mobile after only a few seconds of inactivity. Visible on firefox/safari/chrome on MacOS. 
  a) I've tried using responsive css syntax to override. Doesn't seem to affect the canvas and viewport size. 

#Potential solution
1) writing script that listens for the window size after load and overrides HTML styles if window size width < 481px.
